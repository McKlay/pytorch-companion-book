# Part IV: `torch` in the Real World

Youâ€™ve learned tensors, mastered operations, and explored specialized modules. Now itâ€™s time to **put it all into practice** in real-world workflows.

This part is all about **performance, deployment readiness, debugging, and integration**. Whether you're running models on GPUs, using NumPy, or profiling performance bottlenecks, this section shows you how to keep your models fast, safe, and reliable in production or research settings.

## Chapter 17: Using `torch` with CUDA

This chapter unlocks the power of the GPU:

- Check if CUDA is available and set the right `device`
- Move tensors and models with `.to(device)`
- Use multiple GPUs with `DataParallel`
- Track memory with `memory_allocated()` and `empty_cache()`
- Optimize training with **AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)** using `autocast()` and `GradScaler`
- Tune performance with `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark`

ðŸ’¡ *Key Insight*: Speed doesnâ€™t just come from `.to('cuda')` â€” managing memory, AMP, and reproducibility settings is just as crucial.

## Chapter 18: Integration with NumPy

PyTorch plays **beautifully** with NumPy:

- Convert NumPy â†’ Tensor: `torch.from_numpy(arr)`
- Convert Tensor â†’ NumPy: `tensor.numpy()` (CPU-only)
- Shared memory = fast, zero-copy â€” but be careful with in-place changes
- Interfacing with: `matplotlib`, `pandas`, OpenCV, SciPy, etc.
- Safely detach for export: `.detach().cpu().numpy()`

ðŸ“Œ *Warning*: `.numpy()` drops autograd history and fails on GPU tensors â€” use only in eval, visualization, or exporting.

## Chapter 19: Debugging, Profiling, and Best Practices

This is your PyTorch **survival guide**:

- Debug with:
  - `print(tensor.shape)`
  - `torch.isnan()`, `torch.isinf()`
  - `.grad.norm()` to catch exploding gradients
- Catch autograd issues with `torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)`
- Profile runtime using `torch.profiler.profile()` to spot bottlenecks
- Track GPU memory usage: `memory_summary()`
- Organize code into `model.py`, `train.py`, `utils.py`, `debug.py`
- Best practices:
  - Zero gradients every step
  - Avoid `.data` (use `.detach()` instead)
  - Use `.float()` consistently with inputs/targets
  - Assert input/output shapes often

âœ” *Sanity Checklist Included* â€” the go-to debugging flow for PyTorch practitioners.
