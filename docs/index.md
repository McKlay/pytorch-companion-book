# PyTorch Builder’s Companion Book

Welcome to the **PyTorch Builder’s Companion Book** — your step-by-step guide to understanding the core of PyTorch through real-world reasoning, intuitive code explanations, and progressive deep dives.

This book is structured for learners, builders, and AI engineers who want to move beyond black-box usage and gain mastery over `torch`, the beating heart of PyTorch.

## What You'll Learn

- What `torch` actually is and why it’s essential.
- How to manipulate tensors, the basic unit of deep learning.
- A detailed walkthrough of every major API in `torch`, including:
  - `torch.Tensor`
  - `torch.nn.functional`
  - `torch.linalg`, `torch.fft`, `torch.utils`, and more.
- The math behind the code — with autograd, broadcasting, and matrix ops.
- Real-world debugging, CUDA usage, and best practices.
